   Total Inviscid Force along 1 0 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [N] 
   Total Inviscid Force along 0 1 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [N] 
   Total Inviscid Force along 0 0 1 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [N] 

   Total Viscous  Force along 1 0 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [N] 
   Total Viscous  Force along 0 1 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [N] 
   Total Viscous  Force along 0 0 1 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [N] 

   Moments are calculated around point (+0.000000e+00 +0.000000e+00 +0.000000e+00) [m]

   Total Inviscid Moment along 1 0 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [Nm] 
   Total Inviscid Moment along 0 1 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [Nm] 
   Total Inviscid Moment along 0 0 1 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [Nm] 

   Total Viscous  Moment along 1 0 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [Nm] 
   Total Viscous  Moment along 0 1 0 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [Nm] 
   Total Viscous  Moment along 0 0 1 axis  =  +0.000000e+00 [Nm]

Thesis Project files, simulations and solvers.

#FINEOpen

work developed in Fine. 

#OpenFOAM

Work developed in OpenFOAM 4.x. 

## validation 1 rod

## validation 7 rod

# Modified Open FOAMS

To compile run "wmake -all & wclean all".

## heatConductingFoam

Solver for the solid domain only

## pupoBuoyantSimpleFoam

Solver for the fluid domain only

## pupoCHTFoam

CHT solver

##radiatingwall

compiles "radiatingwall.so". Adds a new BC, radiatingWall, that allows for the removal of radiation from the system.

##outlePrghPressure

compiles "OutletPressurelib.so". Adds a new BC, outletPrghPressure, for the P_rgh gradient of an open channel in natural convection.
